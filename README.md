# Shen
A game made by friends

## Installation

* Install Node (8.12+)
* `npm i` in root of project
* `npm start`

## Notes

* Like Reigns - make decisions that affect a few values
* Like paperclips - hire on employees for example that affect values, increase productivity, etc

* Few values upping and downing
* Current events that can affect rate of change of values
* Real-time / by interaction  (?).
* User has to change behavior / play style according to current events 
  - Dynamicity into the game
  - Not necesarrily interactable / notification
* Automate business (e.g. recruiters who hire people)
* +/- employees, manufacturing
* Multiple products (?)


* Cards w/ yes or no
  - For example, invest in robotics technology 
* Values
  - Employee satisfaction
  - Money (shown)
  - Public perception (smiley face)
  - Stocks
  - Inventory (shown)
  - Marketing
  - Raw materials
* Values may have ceiling or floor
* Per product (depends on multiple projects)
  - Cards could be global / per projects
* Buttons
  - manufacturing, employees, etc.

* Background
* Cards w/ text and images (swipable)
* Buttons
* Text (values)
* Dialog (?)

* DOM or Canvas?
 -> DOM

* Save stuff locally

* Milestones to introduce new values (raw materials -> inventory -> money etc)
* Hard code values more or less
* Having hard coded -> much easier to make story line
* End of game at some point

* Gameplay is main paperclips with yes / no questions w/ penalty for not answering
* Real-time calculation of values

* Manager for decisions (?)


Ideas:
* Buy influence / propaganda maybe in near the end
* Big decisions?


To do:
* Progression / flowchart of game
